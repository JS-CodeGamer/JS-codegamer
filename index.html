                Well this is my first site and is going to be my Portfolio.<br><br>
                I am an experimentalist, I tried to learn the things by trying to rebuild
                them from scratch.
                From childhood I always loved the scientific way and had a curosity of
                how things worked behind the scenes.
                And thats the main reason for me to trying to re-engineer things from
                scratch and finally land in Engineering.
                <br>
                I loved space and astronomy even in my highschool days and after landing in engineering I learned
                about aircrafts and ther design. I truly fell in love with them with my forte being Aerodynamics
                and propulsion.
                <br>
                <br>I also love to play with software and trying to make them do things that they arent designed to do.
                I learned some beginer's knowledge about penitration testing in my highschool.
                Later I also practiced with some online resources such as OverTheWire. Overall i learnt a lot.
                <br>
                <br>My interest is also in Coding. I am fond of coding and bulding any idea that comes into my mind.
                So far I have joined Codechef and Hackerrank and am trying to practice problem from there.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>I would love to read any comment you have on this site in the review section.
